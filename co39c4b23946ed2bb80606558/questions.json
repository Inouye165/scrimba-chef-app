BSOD provides technical information that might be of help for advanced users in solving the cause of the stop error. In older versions of Microsoft OSs, information displayed on the screen when Windows encountered this type of error typically included error code, memory address where it occurred, and the name of the driver that caused it. Starting from Windows 8, the error screen contains a stop code accompanied by a URL and QR code pointing to relevant troubleshooting resources on the Internet. For Windows to continue to operate BSOD requires a system restart, which happens either automatically, or can be performed manually with the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination, or by pressing the computer's power button.",
